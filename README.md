# Neural Style Transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another. this way we can impose color style, patterns, texture of style image on content image while keeping its original structure, composition, and semantics intact.
this technique was first conceptualized by **Leon A. Gatys**, **Alexander S. Ecker** and **Matthias Bethge** in the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576).

## Dataset

# image preprocess [Complete]

# Model [theory + arch]

# optimizer [adam and lbfgs expain]
