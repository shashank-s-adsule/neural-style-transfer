# Neural Style Transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another. this way we can impose color style, patterns, texture of style image on content image while keeping its original structure, composition, and semantics intact.
this technique was first conceptualized by **Leon A. Gatys**, **Alexander S. Ecker** and **Matthias Bethge** in the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576).

## Dataset
This model trains and inference at the same time so we can Load any **Content** or **Style** image to this Model.<br>
for refrence i have used some of images from these dataset
- Content images:
    - [unsplash random images collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lprdosmil/unsplash-random-images-collection)
    - [image captioning dataset random images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shamsaddin97/image-captioning-dataset-random-images)
- Artwork Images:
